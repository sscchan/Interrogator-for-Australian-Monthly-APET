# Interrogator for Australian Monthly Areal Potential Evapotranspiration#

## Target Market ##
  This tool is aimed to help stormwater engineers who uses MUSIC stormwater quality modelling tool to quickly and effectively retrieve Bureau of Meteorlogy's (BOM) Areal Potential Evapotranspiration (APET) data.

## Summary ##
  This tool enables an engineer to select their project location on a map and retrieve the BOM APET data for input for thier MUSIC model.

## Problem ##
  Stromwater engineers in Australia, as part of their MUSIC modelling process, require APET data for their project location as inputs. Common practice is to read off APET value contours (and interpolate values) for each month off the maps in the BOM website. This is slow and often error-prone.

  The "proper" way to obtain the data is off the APET ERSI Grid from the BOM, but the often the engineer does not have sufficient GIS knowledge to do so. This means that the task is delegated to the company's GIS operator, which introduce additional issues such as availability, time and cost.

## Solution ##
  This application solves this issue by allowing an engineer to quickly and easily interrogate APET data on a map, bypassing the issues with eye-balling BOM charts or asking the GIS operator to do the work.
